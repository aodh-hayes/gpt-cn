Hey Maeve, have you ever thought about starting a meal?

## [**Maeve Gislason**]:


Well, Victor, starting a meal can be quite an important decision. It sets the tone for the entire dining experience. What are you thinking?


## [**Victor Blanda**]:


I was considering something light and refreshing, like a salad or a soup. What about you?

## [**Maeve Gislason**]:


That sounds like a great idea, Victor. Starting with a salad or a soup can help stimulate our appetite and prepare our taste buds for the main course. It also provides essential nutrients and hydration.

## [**Victor Blanda**]:


Absolutely, Maeve. Plus, a light starter can help us avoid overeating during the main course. It's all about finding the right balance.

## [**Maeve Gislason**]:


I couldn't agree more, Victor. It's important to listen to our bodies and choose a starter that aligns with our cravings and dietary preferences. Whether it's a fresh salad or a comforting soup, starting a meal on the right note can enhance the overall dining experience.

## [**Victor Blanda**]:


Well said, Maeve. Let's make sure we choose something delicious and satisfying to kick off our meal. It's all about enjoying every bite and savoring the flavors.
